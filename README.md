# Time series analysis using python

This repo is created as a preparation for a time series analysis course. The course will be project-based and will focus mainly on ARIMA models as well Facebook prophet library. Projects will be related to finance, business, economics, with a more focus on financial applications. Python will be used throughout the whole course. 

## Phase 1: Brain storming 

This will initially consist of three parts; 
1- links for useful repos and tutorials     
2- datasets                  3- genuine projects drafts 

### links for tutorials and repos

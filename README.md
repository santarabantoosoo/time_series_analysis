# Time series analysis using python

This repo is created as a preparation for a time series analysis course. The course will be project-based and will focus mainly on ARIMA models as well Facebook prophet library. Projects will be related to finance, business, economics, with a more focus on financial applications. Python will be used throughout the whole course. 

## Phase 1: Brain storming 

This will initially consist of three parts; 
1- links for useful repos and tutorials     
2- datasets                  3- genuine projects drafts 

### links for tutorials and repos

I have forked this project in this repo

**topics to consider** 

[Time Series Forecasting Methods | Arima In Python and R](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/08/auto-arima-time-series-modeling-python-r/)    This tutorial describes a use case for AUTOARIMA.   



### datasets   

1- [Unemployment Rate (UNRATE) | FRED | St. Louis Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)

The most popular dataset with the tag `unemployment` 

*Advantages*   long duration, all states, 

2- [Job Openings (Levels and Rates) | FRED | St. Louis Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/32243)

I was thinking of including all the four datasets, so that it includes levels, rates as well as seasonal adjusted and non seasonal adjusted datasets. This way I think, we can test students' ability to remove seasonality from the dataset.
Also, this dataset ends in Jan 2021. Students may forecast the whole year of 2021. Later, maybe an update of the dataset maybe published and they can compare their predictions to the actual results.  

Finally, I think we can relate job openings with [Hires (Levels and Rates) | FRED | St. Louis Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/32245) as well as [Quits (Levels and Rates) | FRED | St. Louis Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/32247) 

3- [Cryptocurrencies | FRED | St. Louis Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/33913) 

When I looked at the graphs for bitcoin and ethereum, it seemed to me like an unprecendented increase. 


4- [By Country | FRED | St. Louis Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/158)

I was wondering whether we can sample five countries and link these datasets with Covid datasets.
